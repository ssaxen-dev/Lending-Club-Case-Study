# Lending Club Case Study
> We are Working for a consumer finance institution specializing in providing loans to urban customers, our company faces the critical task of evaluating loan applications. In making approval decisions, we navigate two primary risks:

	- Denying a loan to a potentially creditworthy applicant may result in a missed business opportunity for the company.

	- Approving a loan for an applicant with a high likelihood of defaulting poses a financial risk and potential loss for the company.

Hence we will use concepts of EDA learned to find the way to avoid lending money to those who have high chance of defaulting to avoid loss.

## General Information

  This is part of EDA assignement for upgrad's Masters in ML & AI where we will be applying the EDA techniques learned showcasing the understanding of how data can be used to find defaulters and avoid lending money to them to save the risk of financial loss.

  Normally financial sectors like banks, fintech etc lend money to customers where customers have to pay certain amount at certain duration to repay that lended money. This case study will help us find how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.

  We are trying to solve the business problem to identify patterns which indicates if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.	

  We are using "loan data set" as data set and "data dictionary" providing the meaning of the variables/ column names in loan data set.
